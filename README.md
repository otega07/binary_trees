This is a README file for C-Binary trees

This is a project where i learnt about the details, advantages,
and disadvantages of using trees as data structures.
I learned about how to qualify trees as well as how to traverse them. Throughout the project, I
implemented binary, binary search, AVL, and Max Binary Heap trees.
